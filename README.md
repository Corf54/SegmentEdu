You're in the main folder of SegmentEdu, the educational-recreational game.

Apart from this file, README.md, it should contain the following files:
	SegmentEdu.py - main game file
	se_config.py - config file
	se_styles.py - cosmetics file
	se_classes.py - Python programming language classes used by the game
	at least one localization file, named in this fashion: localization_LANGUAGE-INDEX.py
	COPYING file, which contains the terms of the license the game is released under
As well as these folders:
	Resources - with the images, sounds, etc. used by the game.
	Levels - Holds files with parameters that determine objects that make up a level
It probably also contains these files:
	CHANGELOG - The changelog of the game
	TO_DO - list of changes to (potentially) implement to the game

If modifying and redistributing the software, remember - it can only be redistributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v3.0 license, and must contain at least, but not limited to the copyright notice and the terms of the license its released under. :)
